**DAY 1
Important Things learnt:**

1} React Router DOM is a library that helps you handle routing in React applications. It allows you to create a Single Page Application (SPA) with different URLs or routes for different views, without the need for a full page refresh.
For example, in a food delivery website, you might have different pages like Home, Menu, Order, and Checkout. React Router DOM allows you to show different components for each of these pages based on the URL (e.g., /home, /menu, /checkout).

2} A JSX file is a file that contains JSX (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension for JavaScript used in React to describe how the user interface (UI) should look. JSX allows you to write HTML-like code directly within JavaScript, which is then compiled into regular JavaScript by tools like Babel.
